## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Css preprocesor
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use the adjacent sibling selector to make the view icon appear on hover.

```scss
.view {
  display: none;
}

.image-container:hover .overlay + .view {
  display: block;
}
```
### Continued development
For future projects I need to focus on using more advanced CSS to create effects.

### Useful resources

- [How To Create an Overlay Image Icon](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_icon.asp) - This helped me to add an overlay to the image on hover.
- [Using only CSS, show div on hover over another element](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5210033/using-only-css-show-div-on-hover-over-another-element) - This Stack Overflow question helped me to figure out how to show the view icon on hover.
